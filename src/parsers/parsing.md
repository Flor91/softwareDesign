# Parsing Text

Parsing is a crucial process in computer science that converts human-readable text into machine-friendly objects. It relies on grammar rules to recognize patterns and uses tokenization to break down the text. Precedence helps prioritize operations, and operator overloading allows customization of built-in operators. Understanding these concepts is essential for effective text and data processing in programming.

## Key Concepts
- **Parsing**: Transforming human-readable text into computer-friendly objects.
- **Grammar**: Defines patterns for parsing.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into tokens.
- **Precedence**: Prioritizing patterns during parsing.
- **Operator Overloading**: Customizing built-in operator behavior.

## Detailed Notes

- **Parsing**:
  - **Definition**: The process of transforming text that's easy for people to read into objects that are easy for computers to work with.
  - **Purpose**: Helps in understanding and processing text data programmatically.

- **Grammar**:
  - **Definition**: A set of rules that defines the textual patterns a parser recognizes.
  - **Role**: Acts as a blueprint for the parser to identify and interpret text structures.

- **Tokenization**:
  - **Definition**: The process of breaking input text into smaller pieces called tokens.
  - **Example**: In the sentence "The cat sat on the mat," each word can be a token.

- **Precedence**:
  - **Definition**: A mechanism to prioritize different patterns or operations during parsing.
  - **Example**: In mathematical expressions, multiplication is prioritized over addition (e.g., in `3 + 4 * 5`, the multiplication is performed first).

- **Operator Overloading**:
  - **Definition**: The ability to define custom behaviors for built-in operators.
  - **Example**: In Python, you can overload the `+` operator for a custom class by defining the `__add__` method.
