# Finding Duplicate Files

Understanding hash functions and their properties is crucial for identifying duplicate files.

- Big-oh notation helps estimate the efficiency of algorithms.
- Cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 provide unique identifiers for file contents.
- Efficient data handling often involves managing collisions and using streaming APIs to process large datasets incrementally.

### Key Concepts:
- **Hash Function**: Creates a fixed-size value from an arbitrary sequence of bytes.
- **Big-Oh Notation**: Estimates the running time of algorithms.
- **Deterministic Output**: Hash function's output is predictable but not easily reversible.
- **Even Distribution**: A good hash function's output is evenly spread out.
- **Cryptographic Hash**: Can uniquely identify a file's contents.

### Detailed Notes:

- **Big-Oh Notation**:
  - **Definition**: A way to express how the running time or memory requirements of an algorithm increase as the size of the problem increases.
  - **Example**: If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), its running time grows linearly with the input size.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Definition**: The way the running time of an algorithm grows as a function of the problem size, usually expressed using **big-oh notation**.
  - **Example**: Sorting algorithms like quicksort have a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case.

- **Binary Mode**:
  - **Definition**: An option for reading or writing files in which each byte is transferred literally, as opposed to **text mode**.
  - **Example**: Reading a binary file in binary mode ensures that no data is altered during the read process.

- **Hash Function**:
  - **Definition**: A function that turns arbitrary data into a bit array, or a **key**, of a fixed size. Used to determine where data should be stored in a **hash table**.
  - **Example**: MD5 and SHA-256 are common hash functions used to generate unique hashes for data.

- **Hash Code**:
  - **Definition**: A value generated by a **hash function**. Good hash codes behave like random numbers to minimize **collisions**.
  - **Example**: The hash code for the string "hello" using SHA-256 is a unique 256-bit value.

- **Cryptographic Hash Function**:
  - **Definition**: A **hash function** that produces an apparently-random value for any input.
  - **Example**: SHA-256 is a widely used cryptographic hash function.

- **SHA-256 (Hash Function)**:
  - **Definition**: A **cryptographic hash function** that produces a 256-bit output.
  - **Example**: Commonly used in blockchain technology to ensure data integrity.

- **Bucket**:
  - **Definition**: A subset of values from a dataset, typically represented by a single bar in a histogram.
  - **Example**: In a hash table, a bucket may contain multiple entries that have the same hash code.

- **Collision (in Hashing)**:
  - **Definition**: A situation in which two or more values have the same **hash code**.
  - **Example**: Handling collisions is a critical aspect of designing efficient hash tables.

- **Streaming API**:
  - **Definition**: An **API** that processes data in chunks rather than needing to have all of it in memory at once. Requires handlers for events such as “start of data”, “next block”, and “end of data”.
  - **Example**: APIs used for processing large files or real-time data streams, such as video or audio streaming services.
