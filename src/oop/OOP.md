# Object-Oriented Programming

Python is an object-oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A class is like an object constructor or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Key Concepts

### Classes and Objects
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a contract that code using its instances can rely on.
- **Object**: An instance of a class. It has attributes (data) and methods (functions).

### Polymorphism
- Polymorphism allows different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they implement the same interface.
- Reduces cognitive load by letting users ignore the differences between objects that adhere to the same contract.

### Inheritance
- **Inheritance**: A way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. It helps in code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical classification.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Python allows a class to inherit from multiple classes.

### Methods
- **Class Methods**: Functions defined inside a class that take the class itself as a parameter rather than an instance of the class.
- **Static Methods**: Functions defined within a class that do not require an instance of the class or the class itself as a parameter.

### Cache
- A storage mechanism that keeps copies of data to fulfill future requests faster. Commonly used in hardware (e.g., CPU cache) and software (e.g., reducing network traffic).

## Benefits of OOP
1. **Natural Representation**: Provides a natural way of representing real-world "things" in code.
2. **Organized Code**: Makes the code easier to understand, test, and extend by organizing it into classes and objects.

## Glossary

- **Class**: A blueprint for objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class.
- **Attribute**: A variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.
- **Method**: A function defined within a class that operates on instances of the class.
- **Constructor**: A special method used to initialize objects.
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism for creating a new class from an existing class.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to use different classes interchangeably through a common interface.
- **Class Method**: A method that receives the class as its first argument.
- **Static Method**: A method that does not receive an implicit first argument (neither the instance nor the class).
- **Cache**: A storage layer that holds copies of data for faster access.
